    """gRPC backend transport for LivestreamService.

    Using Live Stream API, you can generate live streams in the
    various renditions and streaming formats. The streaming format
    include HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and Dynamic Adaptive Streaming
    over HTTP (DASH). You can send a source stream in the various
    ways, including Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) and Secure
    Reliable Transport (SRT).

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
